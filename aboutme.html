    <h1> About Me </h1>
        
<p> My Name is Sidney LaMontagne. I am 19 years old and live in
 <A HREF= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangor,_Maine"> Bangor, Maine </A>
Bangor, Maine.<p>
<p>
I grew up in a small town with my mom and grandparents, 
in Southern Maine called 
<A HREF= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baldwin,_Maine"> West Baldwin </A> 
near
 <A HREF= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebago_Lake"> Sebago Lake. </A>
 
My mom married my step dad and we moved to <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson,_Maine"> 
Hudson, Maine </A> 

From there on we have lived in Bangor, and have lived here since 2006.  <p>
 <p> One of my passions through life has been film. I have always loved movies since I
 could remember. The summer before my Freshman year of high school I started to get more
 into film, I attended a summer camp in Portland called New England Film Academy. It was a 
 two week camp that we created a ten minute script, filmed and edited in a short amount 
 of time.<p>
 <p> Throughout high school I always thought I had wanted to pursue film and go to college
for film and continue that as a career. During the middle of my Junior Year, I started
working at Chick-fil-A. Midway through my Senior Year I really enjoyed working and realized 
that I wanted to work for Chick-fil-A more and decided to start pursuing different 
opportunities within the company.<p>

<P> So now here we are in 2019. I am a Business Major at the University of Maine and am 
pursuing my Bachelors in Business Management with a Minor in Political Science.<p>

<p> I am excited to continue my journey through work and school to see what I am able to 
succeed in throughout my career. <p>s
