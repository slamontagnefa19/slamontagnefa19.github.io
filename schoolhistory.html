        Bangor High School </h2>
        
        <p> I started at Bangor High in 2014. I went here for all four years of my High 
        School Career. During my time here I served as the Baseball and Basketball manager
        for both JV and Varsity teams and enjoyed it throughly. <p>

    <h2> University of Maine </h2>
    
    <p>In November of 2017 I applied to the University of Maine. I was unsure of the Major I
    wanted to go for. As it would anyone, this made me worried and unsure about my future.<p>
    <p> As I stated in my <A HREF="aboutme.html"> About Me</A> page, halfway though my Senior 
    Year I knew I wanted to pursue a business career. So I chose my major and now I am here. 
    This is my second year in the <A HREF="https://umaine.edu/business/"> Maine Business School, </A>
    and I am excited to finish my degree here and pursue what Chick-fil-A has to offer.
